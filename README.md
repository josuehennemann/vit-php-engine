Vit-PHP-engine
==============

A set of utilities/approach-enforcers for websites that I used to develop in PHP.

History
-------

The code is fairly old: it dates back to pre-2008 times when I was a free-lance web developer. 

I don't think it is modern by any means, but having it collect dust on my private hard drive is not any better than open-sourcing it, so here it is.
